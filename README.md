# The Snake
Snake is simple minigame in java. I used Java Swing to display game. Obstacles on the map are generated randomly. 
Snake will speed up after getting longer. The goal of the game is to become as long as possible. 
Snake will die after hitting obstacle, edge of the map or itself.

## Controls:
- Arrows or WSAD to change dirction of the snake,
- Space to pause/ unpasue/ restart game
